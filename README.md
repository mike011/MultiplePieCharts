# MultiplePieCharts

Inspired by a recent UI I saw that had a custom clickable pie graph, I created a simple of example of how I thought it would be implemented. This is no where close to how complicated the view I saw was. I had a great time exploring [UIControl](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol) and specifically drawing custom images to the screen and making it clickable.

I also explored using @IBDesignable which make it's really powerful to the see preview in the Interface Builder but also really frusterating when it doesn't work as all you get is that the build failed from Xcode and you have to go hunting through the log files to figure out what the error message was. Then you need to figure out the reason why it crashed.
